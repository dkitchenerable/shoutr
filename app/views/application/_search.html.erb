<!-- 
  By using a symbol ":search", the form looks for the instance variable search and prefill with attributes, thus term is prefilled!
--> 
<%= form_for :search, url: search_path, method: :get do |form| %>
  <%= form.text_field :term, placeholder: "Search here" %>
  <%= form.submit "Search" %>
<% end %>
